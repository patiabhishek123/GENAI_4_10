As the president of the United States, Donald Trump has taken several executive actions restricting entry into the United States by certain foreign nationals. His first-term travel bans affected seven of the 49 Muslim-majority countries, were challenged in court, and were criticized by his opponents as targeting Muslim nationals.[1]

Most were subsequently revoked by Joe Biden in 2021. In January 2025, during his second term, Trump signed an executive order aimed at developing new travel restrictions for national security. A second travel ban went into effect on June 9, 2025.

Comments during 2016 presidential campaign
On December 2, 2015, a terrorist attack, consisting of a mass shooting and an attempted bombing, occurred at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California, United States. On December 7, 2015, as a candidate for president, Donald Trump, called for "a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on."[2][3] His comments were condemned by several of his competitors for the Republican nomination, including Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and Lindsey Graham, as well as by several Republican state party chairmen, civil rights activist Ibrahim Hooper of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), and Democratic candidates for president Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley.[2][3]

Travel ban in the first Trump administration
Trump's first travel ban was imposed with Executive Order 13769, issued on January 27, 2017.[4][5]

It was labeled a "Muslim ban" by Trump and his aides,[6][7] as well as his critics,[8][9] and became widely known as such since the ban mostly impacted countries with predominantly Muslim populations.[10] In addition to the restrictions on entry by foreign nationals, North Korea was the only country targeted with a reverse travel ban, prohibiting American citizens from traveling to North Korea.

On January 20, 2021, newly inaugurated president Joe Biden issued a proclamation revoking the Trump travel bans, with the exception of the reverse travel ban prohibiting American citizens from traveling to North Korea.

Executive actions
Executive Order 13769, Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States (January 27, 2017) – The original travel ban. Travel ban for people from seven majority-Muslim countries (Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen) for 90 days, with certain exceptions:[11]
Also suspended refugee resettlement for 120 days and banned Syrian refugees indefinitely. Lowered cap for refugee admissions for fiscal year 2017 from 110,000 to 50,000.[11]
Blocked by Washington v. Trump on Feb. 3, 2017. Trump declined to continue to defend in court.[11]
Executive Order 13780 (March 6, 2017) – The second and revised travel ban rescinding the original travel ban. Travel ban for people from six majority-Muslim countries (same as above, minus Iraq) for 90 days:[11]
This ban exempted those who already have visas and green cards.[11]
Also suspended refugee resettlement for 120 days. Lowered cap for refugee admissions for fiscal year 2017 from 110,000 to 50,000.[11]
Presidential Proclamation 9645 (September 24, 2017) – A third travel ban that replaced the second one. Travel ban for certain nationals of Venezuela, North Korea, and six majority-Muslim countries (five of the countries above, removing Sudan, and adding Chad).[11]
Executive Order 13815 (October 24, 2017) – Suspended processing and admissions of refugees from North Korea, South Sudan and nine majority-Muslim countries (Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen) for at least 90 days while agencies "conducted a review and analysis":[11]
Also suspended processing and admissions of family members entering through the follow-to-join process, while agencies added security procedures.[11]
After the 90 day review process, the Department of Homeland Security issued a press release that all refugee processing would resume, but additional security measures would be applied to certain countries.[11]
Presidential Proclamation 9723 (April 10, 2018) – A proclamation removed the travel restrictions on Chad.[11]
Presidential Proclamation 9983 (January 31, 2020) – An expansion of Presidential Proclamation 9645 to additional countries:[11]
Prohibited certain types of immigrant visa entries by certain nationals who did not already have a valid visa.[11]
Provided detailed explanation of the process used to add or remove countries from the restricted list.[12]
Court challenges
Executive Order 13769
Darweesh v. Trump (NY): filed on behalf of two Iraqi IRAP clients who were detained at JFK airport and threatened with deportation because the executive order was issued while they were traveling to the U.S.[13]
In response, the court blocked deportations under the executive order, leading to the release of approximately 2,000 people. The government agreed to reach out to everyone who was denied entry or deported under the Executive Order and who had not yet reapplied for a visa or returned to the U.S. to inform them of their right to reapply for a visa.[13]
Two days later, a federal judge in New York granted the Darweesh plaintiffs' request for a nationwide temporary injunction blocking the deportation of all people stranded in U.S. airports under Trump's new Muslim ban. Four other courts also weighed in, favoring the Darweesh court ruling.[13]
Washington v. Trump (Washington District Court - February 3, 2017): blocked the executive order within a week of it going into effect. Trump abandoned his effort to defend.[11]
Does v. Trump (Washington District Court - February 7, 2017): class action lawsuit challenging the first executive order.[11]
IRAP v. Trump (Maryland District Court - February 7, 2017): sued Trump on behalf of organizations, charging that the ban violates the First Amendment's prohibition of government establishment of religion and the Fifth Amendment's guarantees of equal treatment under the law.[14]
Executive Order 13780
Hawaii v. Trump (Hawaii District Court - March 15, 2017): blocked the second executive order travel ban and refugee ban before they took effect on constitutional grounds. The 9th Circuit affirmed the decision on statutory grounds.[15]
The Supreme Court allowed the government to implement the travel ban and refugee ban, except with respect to those with "bona fide relationships." Subsequently, the Supreme Court left in place a lower court order defining "bona fide relationships" to include grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins.[15]
The Supreme Court also issued an order that allowed refugees with formal assurances from resettlement organizations to be banned unless they have other ties to people or entities in the United States, pending further proceedings.[15]
IRAP v. Trump (Maryland District Court - March 16, 2017): blocked the second executive order's travel ban before it took effect on constitutional grounds. The Fourth Circuit affirmed on constitutional grounds. The Supreme Court limited the Hawaii and IRAP decisions to people with a "bona fide relationship" to a U.S. person or entity, while the legal challenges continued.[14]
Presidential Proclamation 9645
Hawaii v. Trump (Hawaii District Court - October 17, 2017): blocked the third executive order, excluding the nationals of Venezuela and North Korea, based on the likelihood of success on statutory claims.[15]
The Ninth Circuit affirmed on appeal, but limited the injunction to people with "bona fide relationships".[15]
The Supreme Court let the ban go into effect while it reviewed the decision. The Supreme Court upheld the administration's ban.[15]
IRAP v. Trump (Maryland District Court - October 17, 2017): also blocked the third executive order, excluding the nationals of Venezuela and North Korea and those who lacked a "bona fide relationship".[14]
Executive Order 13815
Doe v. Trump / Jewish Family Services v. Trump (consolidated cases - Washington District Court - December 23, 2017): blocked the fourth executive order relating to refugee admissions with respect to all follow-to-join beneficiaries and all refugees from the targeted countries, who have a "bona fide relationship" to a person or entity in the United States.[15]
Doe is a refugee living in Washington who wanted to be reunited with his wife and children.[15]
The government agreed to prioritize the processing of 315 refugee cases whose applications were still pending because of the suspension and to count any resulting admissions under fiscal year 2018 numbers.[15]

Waivers
Presidential Proclamation 9645 provided for 'waivers' as exceptions to people affected from the countries who need visas. The waivers were supposed to be granted at the discretion of the consular officers who review the applications of those facing a lot of undue hardship that requires them to be with their loved ones in the United States. For example, if a family member in the United States is dying, a person from the country with a travel ban on it would be granted a waiver to see their family member one last time. However, only 2% of the people who applied for the waiver were granted one. From 33,176 applicants through April 30, 2018, 579 applicants had been granted the waiver.[16]

Reverse travel ban to North Korea
In 2017, following the death of Otto Warmbier, the Trump administration issued a reverse travel ban prohibiting American citizens from traveling to North Korea. President Biden's revocation of the Trump travel ban did not include a reversal of the travel ban to North Korea.[20] The reverse travel ban was issued for one year, but has been renewed on an annual basis since August 2018. Unless extended again, the ban remains in effect until August 31, 2026.[21]

Travel ban in the second Trump administration

Countries affected by the June 4, 2025 proclamation
   Nationals banned from traveling to the U.S.
   Nationals partially restricted from traveling to the U.S.
Executive actions
Main article: Proclamation 10949
On January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14161 titled “Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats”. The order seeks to protect Americans “from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten [U.S.] national security, espouse hateful ideologies, or otherwise exploit immigration laws for malevolent purposes.” To achieve this goal, the order calls for enhanced vetting and screening measures for all foreign nationals seeking to enter or already present in the United States since January 20, 2021. It directs federal agencies a 60-day period to review, recommend, and implement necessary updates to existing procedures to ensure national security and public safety.[35]

In doing so, the order also seeks to identify deficiencies in the information needed to assess whether nationals of particular countries pose a security threat, using a standardized risk assessment baseline. If a foreign government fails to provide adequate information, or if other risk factors are present, the administration may impose entry restrictions and take steps to remove individuals already in the country. The order may reinstate and expand upon earlier directives issued during Trump's first term, commonly referred to as the “travel ban”.[36]

On March 14, 2025, The New York Times reported that the Trump administration released a draft list of 43 countries that could be affected under EO 14161. It lists three tiers of countries (red, orange and yellow) whose citizens may face restrictions on entering the United States.[37]

List of countries under travel ban
On June 4, 2025, President Donald Trump issued a proclamation, restricting entry from Afghanistan, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, as well as partially restricting entry from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.[38]

Tier	Description	Affected Countries
Full	Full entry ban: Citizens are completely barred from entering the U.S. under any visa category, either immigrant or non-immigrant. Certain exceptions apply such as Special Immigrant Visa for Afghans or Immigrant visas for Iranians subjected to ethnic and religious persecution in their country.	
Partial	Partial restrictions: Citizens are banned from entering the U.S. on B-1, B-2, B-1/B-2, F, M, and J Visas, either immigrant or non-immigrant.
